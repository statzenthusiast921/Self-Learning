#Lesson 80 - Neural Networks Fundamentals

#subset of machine learning. - in case of deep learning, you don't need to
#specify features

#based on neuron and human brain's functioning

#neuron (aka nerve cell) is unit of human nervous system.  It is like a wire 
#used to conduct stimulu.  Our body contains senses in the form of receptors
#to brain.  For example, if we think of lifting anything, our brain will use
#neurons to send this signal to hand (muscles) which will then lift the object.
#Our entire body contains stacks of neurons.

#Deep learning is based on mimicking this behavior, deep learning is about
#training these neural networks to deliver desired results


#no guideline of number of hidden layers or number of neurons in a hidden layer
#logistic regresion itself can be used as a single layer neuron network where
#you will only have an output layer and no hidden layer
#neural networks with lesser layers like logistic regression with 1 layer
#is called shallow neural network and neural network with many hidden layers
#is called deep layer neural network
